- [ ] Task 6.2: Add GitHub Actions workflow for docs deployment
- [ ] Task 6.3: Configure docker-compose with docs profile
- [ ] Task 6.4: Add Makefile targets for common doc operations
- [ ] Task 6.5: Test full CI/CD pipeline with validation gates

## Remaining Phase 2 Tasks 📋 PENDING

- [ ] Task 2.4: Update linkcheck-skip.txt for legitimate external links
- [ ] Task 2.5: Test build with strict mode and fix all warnings

## Priority Actions Next:

1. **Phase 5.1**: Configure Mermaid v10+ with interactive features
2. **Phase 5.2**: Create custom admonitions for project-specific content
3. **Phase 5.3**: Set up social card generation with branding
4. **Phase 5.4**: Implement progressive image loading
5. **Phase 5.5**: Add JSON-LD structured data
6. **Phase 2.4-2.5**: Complete remaining strict mode tasks
7. **Phase 6**: Full Docker and CI/CD integration

## Implementation Strategy:

- Continue with automated approach (no manual intervention)
- Use get_errors after each task to ensure quality
- Test each component individually before integration
- Update changes.md continuously
- Provide retrospective after each phase
