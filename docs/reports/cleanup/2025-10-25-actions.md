# Cleanup Actions Completed

## Documentation Reformatting

**DEVELOPMENT_DEBT.md:**

## Documentation Restructuring

**Method:** Decomposed large reports into focused dated entries
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "docs/reports/{cleanup,debt,setup}"
# Created focused files ≤150w with YAML front matter
```

**Files Decomposed:**
1. CLEANUP-SUMMARY.md → docs/reports/cleanup/ (4 files)
2. DEVELOPMENT_DEBT.md → docs/reports/debt/ (4 files)
3. PROJECT-SETUP-COMPLETE.md → docs/reports/setup/ (4 files)

**Benefits:**
- Scannable documentation (≤150w per file)
- Dated entries for version tracking
- YAML front matter for semantic indexing
- Central docs/ structure (SSoT)
