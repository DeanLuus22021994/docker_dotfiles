# Implementation Roadmap

## Critical Path (Weeks 1-2)

**Week 1: Testing Infrastructure (BLOCKER)**
```
Day 1-2: pytest setup + test structure (2h)
Day 3-4: Unit tests (utils, validation) (6h)
Day 5: Unit tests (audit) + CI/CD (5h)
```

**Blocker:** Testing must be complete before security work.

**Week 2: Security Hardening**
```
Day 1-2: Authentication + rate limiting (8h)
Day 3: HTTPS + reverse proxy (4h)
Day 4: API validation + CORS (3h)
Day 5: Docker socket audit + docs (3h)
```

## High Priority (Weeks 3-4)

**Week 3: Planned Scripts**
```
PowerShell: cleanup + security (8h)
Bash: build-images + cleanup + docs (10h)
```

**Week 4: Documentation**
```
Index + archival (4h)
Consolidation (3h)
MkDocs site (4h)
```

## Medium Priority (Weeks 5-6)

**Week 5: Code Quality Automation**
```
Pre-commit + CI/CD + Dependabot (6h)
```

**Week 6: Dashboard Enhancements (Optional)**
```
Layer features (21h)
```

## Velocity Targets

| Week   | Phase                | Hours | Tasks | Completion % |
|--------|----------------------|-------|-------|--------------|
| Week 1 | Testing              | 13h   | 6     | 0%           |
| Week 2 | Security             | 18h   | 6     | 0%           |
| Week 3 | Scripts              | 18h   | 6     | 0%           |
| Week 4 | Documentation        | 11h   | 4     | 0%           |
| Week 5 | Code Quality         | 6h    | 3     | 0%           |
| Week 6 | Dashboard (Optional) | 21h   | 5     | 0%           |

**Total:** 87 hours across 6 weeks

## Next Steps

1. Review debt analysis with stakeholders
2. Prioritize critical security issues (Phase 4.2)
3. Allocate resources for testing (Phase 4.1)
4. Begin Phase 4.1 with pytest framework setup
5. Track progress in TODO.md

**Status:** ðŸš€ Ready for implementation (2025-10-25)
