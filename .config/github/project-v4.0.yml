# Project Overview
overview: |
  Production readiness iteration focused on:
  - Testing Infrastructure (pytest, coverage, CI/CD)
  - Security Hardening (auth, rate limiting, HTTPS, validation)
  - Planned Scripts (cleanup automation, security scanning, docs generation)
  - Documentation Consolidation (MkDocs site, archival, index)
  - Code Quality Automation (pre-commit, CI workflows, Dependabot)
  - Dashboard Enhancements (layer-specific features, scaling controls)

# Risk Assessment
risks:
  - risk: "Testing framework complexity"
    probability: "Medium"
    impact: "High"
    mitigation: "Start with simple pytest config"
  
  - risk: "Authentication scope creep"
    probability: "High"
    impact: "Medium"
    mitigation: "Use JWT for internal, defer OAuth"
  
  - risk: "Docker socket security issues"
    probability: "Low"
    impact: "High"
    mitigation: "Use read-only mount + proxy"
  
  - risk: "Documentation consolidation delays"
    probability: "Low"
    impact: "Low"
    mitigation: "Follow TODO.md structure"

# Success Criteria
success_criteria:
  - "Coverage >80% across all Python modules"
  - "JWT/OAuth authentication implemented"
  - "All 6 planned scripts completed and documented"
  - "MkDocs site deployed to GitHub Pages"
  - "All code quality checks automated in CI/CD"
  - "Layer-specific dashboard features functional"

# Next Actions
next_actions:
  - "Review project setup with stakeholders"
  - "Prioritize critical security issues (Phase 4.2)"
  - "Allocate resources for testing infrastructure (Phase 4.1)"
  - "Begin Phase 4.1 with pytest framework setup"
  - "Track progress via GitHub issues and project board"
