# Docker Compose Examples - Config-Driven Agent

## Architecture Overview

**Config-Driven CI/CD Automation** with **Customizable Components**:

- **`.config/`**: YAML-driven automation for CI/CD pipelines, environment variables, resource limits, monitoring, and deployment strategies
- **`.dockerfiles/`**: Parameterized Dockerfiles with build args for service customization
- **Python MCP Utilities**: Volume-persisted Python files for AI-assisted development across all stacks
- **GitHub Integration**: Automated workflows for testing, security scanning, and deployment

## Core Principles

### 1. Configuration-Driven Automation
- **Environment Variables**: Centralized configuration management via `.config/*/config.yml`
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: GitHub Actions workflows triggered by config changes
- **Resource Management**: Config-defined CPU/memory limits and scaling rules
- **Monitoring**: Automated metrics collection and alerting based on config

### 2. Customizable Components
- **Dockerfiles**: Build-arg parameterized for environment-specific customization
- **Python MCP**: Volume-mounted utilities for AI-assisted development
- **Service Configuration**: Environment-driven service behavior

### 3. GitHub CI/CD Alignment
- **Automated Testing**: Config-triggered test suites with coverage reporting
- **Security Scanning**: Integrated vulnerability assessment and dependency checks
- **Deployment Automation**: Environment-specific deployment pipelines
- **Monitoring Integration**: Automated health checks and performance monitoring

## CI/CD Automation Features

### GitHub Actions Integration
- **Workflow Triggers**: Push/PR events with environment-specific conditions
- **Build Automation**: Multi-stage Docker builds with build-arg injection
- **Testing Pipeline**: Parallel test execution with coverage reporting
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability assessment and compliance checks
- **Deployment Gates**: Environment-specific approval and deployment workflows

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Centralized config with environment overrides
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variable driven secrets with GitHub Actions integration
- **Resource Limits**: Config-driven CPU/memory allocation and scaling
- **Health Checks**: Automated service monitoring and alerting

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus integration with config-defined endpoints
- **Logging**: Structured logging with configurable drivers and retention
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts based on config-defined thresholds
- **Performance Monitoring**: Resource usage tracking and optimization

## Customization Points

### Dockerfile Customization
```dockerfile
# .dockerfiles/python.Dockerfile
ARG ENVIRONMENT=development
ARG SERVICE_TYPE=basic
ARG WORKERS=1

# Environment-specific customizations
RUN if [ "$ENVIRONMENT" = "production" ]; then \
        apt-get update && apt-get install -y monitoring-tools; \
    fi
```

### Python MCP Customization
- **Volume Persistence**: `docker_examples_python_mcp` volume for cross-build persistence
- **Environment Integration**: Config-driven environment variable injection
- **Service Discovery**: Automated service registration and discovery

### Config-Driven Scaling
```yaml
# .config/cluster-example/config.yml
scaling:
  python:
    min_replicas: 1
    max_replicas: 5
    target_cpu_utilization: 70
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Configuration First
- Modify `.config/*/config.yml` for environment and deployment changes
- Update environment variables and resource limits
- Configure CI/CD triggers and monitoring

### 2. Customization Second
- Customize dockerfiles in `.dockerfiles/` for service-specific requirements
- Add Python utilities to MCP volume for AI-assisted development
- Configure build args for environment-specific builds

### 3. Automation Always
- GitHub Actions automatically builds, tests, and deploys based on config
- Monitoring automatically collects metrics based on config
- Scaling automatically adjusts based on config-defined rules

## Stack-Specific Automation

### Basic Stack (Development)
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing on push/PR
- **Environment**: Development with hot reload
- **Monitoring**: Basic health checks and logging

### Cluster Example (Staging)
- **CI/CD**: Load testing and integration tests
- **Environment**: Production-like with load balancing
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics and alerting

### Swarm Stack (Production)
- **CI/CD**: Full security scanning and compliance checks
- **Environment**: Production with rolling updates
- **Monitoring**: Enterprise-grade observability and alerting

### MCP Utilities (Testing)
- **CI/CD**: Code quality and security validation
- **Environment**: Testing with comprehensive coverage
- **Monitoring**: Test metrics and quality reporting

## GitHub Integration

### Automated Workflows
- **Build**: Multi-stage Docker builds with config injection
- **Test**: Parallel test execution with coverage reporting
- **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning and compliance
- **Deploy**: Environment-specific deployment with rollbacks

### Repository Management
- **Issues**: Automated issue creation for failures
- **PR Checks**: Config-driven pull request validation
- **Releases**: Automated versioning and changelog generation

## Summary

**Config-Driven Architecture** where:
- **Configuration** drives CI/CD automation, monitoring, and deployment
- **Dockerfiles** provide service customization points
- **Python MCP** enables AI-assisted development
- **GitHub** provides automated workflow execution

This architecture ensures **maintainable**, **scalable**, and **automated** Docker deployments with clear separation between configuration and customization.
