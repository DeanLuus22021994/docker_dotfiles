## 1. Pre-deployment Validation

```bash
# Validate environment
python scripts/python/validation/validate_env.py

# Validate configs
python scripts/python/validation/validate_configs.py

# Validate Docker Compose
docker-compose config
```

## 2. Build Images

```bash
# Build all services
docker-compose build

# Or build specific services
docker-compose build api nginx
```

## 3. Start Services

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

## 4. Verify Deployment

**Health checks:**

```bash
# Traefik dashboard
curl -I https://traefik.your-domain.com

# API health
curl https://your-domain.com/api/health

# All services
docker-compose ps
```

## 5. Post-Deployment

- Create admin user (see authentication.md)
- Configure monitoring alerts
- Set up backup jobs
- Document service URLs
- Test all endpoints

## Rollback

```bash
# Stop services
docker-compose down

# Restore previous version
git checkout previous-tag
docker-compose up -d
```
