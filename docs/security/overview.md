# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our Docker stack seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via GitHub Security Advisories:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/DeanLuus22021994/docker_dotfiles/security/advisories)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill in the details

Alternatively, you can email security concerns to: [Your Security Email - Update This]

Please include the following information:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of affected source files
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- We will provide a more detailed response within 7 days indicating the next steps
- We will keep you informed about the progress toward a fix and public disclosure
- We may ask for additional information or guidance

### Disclosure Policy

- We aim to fix critical vulnerabilities within 30 days
- High severity vulnerabilities within 60 days
- Medium and low severity within 90 days

After fixing a vulnerability, we will:

1. Release a security update
2. Publish a security advisory
3. Credit you (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and data destruction
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond the minimum necessary to demonstrate the issue
- Report vulnerabilities promptly
- Keep vulnerability details confidential until we've had a reasonable time to respond

We will not take legal action against you or request law enforcement to investigate you for actions conducted pursuant to this policy.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Never commit `.env` file** - It's already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use strong passwords** - Minimum 16 characters, mix of letters/numbers/symbols
3. **Rotate credentials regularly** - At least every 90 days
4. **Enable 2FA** - On all service accounts (GitHub, Docker Hub, etc.)
5. **Keep dependencies updated** - Review Dependabot PRs weekly
6. **Run security scans** - Use `make validate-configs` before deploying
7. **Limit access** - Only grant necessary permissions to services
8. **Monitor logs** - Check container logs for suspicious activity

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables only
2. **Run pre-commit hooks** - Automated via `cluster-pre-commit` service
3. **Keep base images updated** - Use specific versions, not `latest`
4. **Scan images** - Trivy scans run automatically in CI/CD
5. **Follow least privilege** - Run containers as non-root users
6. **Validate inputs** - Never trust user-provided data
7. **Use read-only mounts** - For configuration files (`:ro` flag)

## Security Features

### Enabled in This Repository

- ✅ **Secret Scanning** - Detects accidentally committed secrets
- ✅ **Push Protection** - Blocks commits containing secrets
- ✅ **Dependabot Alerts** - Notifies of vulnerable dependencies
- ✅ **Dependabot Security Updates** - Auto-creates PRs for security fixes
- ✅ **Code Scanning** - CodeQL analysis for Python and JavaScript
- ✅ **Container Scanning** - Trivy scans all Docker images
- ✅ **Dependency Review** - Blocks PRs with high/critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Pre-commit Hooks** - Validates code before commit

### Docker Security

- Non-root users in all containers
- Read-only root filesystems where possible
- Minimal base images (slim, alpine variants)
- Multi-stage builds to reduce attack surface
- Health checks for all services
- Resource limits (CPU, memory)
- Isolated network (bridge mode)
- No privileged containers

### Network Security

- Internal network isolation
- Rate limiting via nginx
- CORS policies configured
- No exposed sensitive ports
- TLS/SSL for production deployments (via reverse proxy)

### Data Security

- Encrypted volumes (at-rest encryption via Docker/OS)
- Database credentials via environment variables
- Backup encryption recommended
- No plaintext secrets in logs
- Log rotation (10MB × 3 files per service)

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported and acknowledged
- **Day 1-7**: Vulnerability triaged and severity assessed
- **Day 7-30**: Fix developed and tested (critical vulnerabilities)
- **Day 30-60**: Fix developed and tested (high severity)
- **Day 60-90**: Fix developed and tested (medium/low severity)
- **Release Day**: Security update published
- **Release Day + 7**: Public disclosure (unless coordinated with reporter)

## Contact

For security concerns, please use:

- **Preferred**: [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/DeanLuus22021994/docker_dotfiles/security/advisories)
- **Alternative**: [Your Security Email]
- **Not for security**: Public issues or pull requests

## Acknowledgments

We thank all security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us.
