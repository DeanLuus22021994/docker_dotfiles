## Monitoring Tools

**1. Falco** - Runtime security monitoring for anomalous container behavior
**2. Sysdig** - Container security platform with network traffic analysis
**3. Docker Bench Security** - CIS Docker Benchmark checks
**4. Prometheus + Grafana** - API metrics and custom alerts

## Key Indicators of Compromise

1. Privileged container creation (`--privileged` flag in logs)
2. Unusual container mount points (`-v /:/host` patterns)
3. High volume API calls (rate limit exceeded alerts)
4. Failed authentication attempts (auth log spikes)

## Incident Response

**Immediate Actions:**

1. Isolate affected container (network disconnect)
2. Snapshot container state for forensics
3. Review audit logs for timeline
4. Check for persistence mechanisms

**Investigation:**

- Analyze Docker API logs
- Review authentication logs
- Check for modified containers
- Inspect running processes

**Remediation:**

- Stop compromised container
- Rebuild from known-good image
- Rotate all secrets (JWT, API keys)
- Patch vulnerability if identified
- Update security policies

**Prevention:**

- Implement socket proxy if not present
- Tighten rate limits
- Enable additional monitoring
- Conduct security training
- Document lessons learned
