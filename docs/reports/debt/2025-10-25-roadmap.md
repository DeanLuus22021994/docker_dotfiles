## Critical Path (Weeks 1-2)

**Week 1: Testing (BLOCKER)** - pytest setup (2h), unit tests (9h), CI/CD (2h). Must complete before security.

**Week 2: Security** - Auth/rate limits (8h), HTTPS/proxy (4h), validation/CORS (3h), socket audit (3h)

## High Priority (Weeks 3-4)

**Week 3: Scripts** - PowerShell cleanup/security (8h), Bash build/docs (10h)

**Week 4: Docs** - Index/archival (4h), consolidation (3h), MkDocs (4h)

## Medium Priority (Weeks 5-6)

**Week 5: Quality** - Pre-commit/CI/Dependabot (6h)

**Week 6: Dashboard** - Layer features (21h, optional)

## Velocity Targets

| Week   | Phase                | Hours | Tasks | Completion % |
| ------ | -------------------- | ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| Week 1 | Testing              | 13h   | 6     | 0%           |
| Week 2 | Security             | 18h   | 6     | 0%           |
| Week 3 | Scripts              | 18h   | 6     | 0%           |
| Week 4 | Documentation        | 11h   | 4     | 0%           |
| Week 5 | Code Quality         | 6h    | 3     | 0%           |
| Week 6 | Dashboard (Optional) | 21h   | 5     | 0%           |

**Total:** 87 hours across 6 weeks

## Next Steps

1. Review debt analysis with stakeholders
2. Prioritize critical security issues (Phase 4.2)
3. Allocate resources for testing (Phase 4.1)
4. Begin Phase 4.1 with pytest framework setup
5. Track progress in TODO.md

**Status:** ðŸš€ Ready for implementation (2025-10-25)
