# 🔧 Key Tools Overview

> *Essential tools powering Docker Compose development and AI-assisted workflows*

---

## 🛠️ Development Tools

### GitHub CLI
**Command-line interface for GitHub operations** 🚀

**Why it matters**: Streamlines GitHub workflows, integrates with CI/CD pipelines, and supports automation scripts.

**Usage tips**:
```bash
gh repo clone <repo>          # Quick cloning
gh pr create                  # PR management
gh issue list                 # Track work
```

**Integration**: Powers the agent's GitHub operations tool, enabling automated repository interactions.

---

### Docker Compose
**Multi-container orchestration made simple** 🐳

**Why it matters**: Simplifies local development environments, ensures consistent deployments, and supports scaling.

**Usage tips**:
```bash
docker-compose up -d           # Background services
docker-compose logs -f         # Real-time monitoring
docker-compose exec <service>  # Debug containers
```

**Integration**: Core to all stack deployments (basic, cluster, swarm), with agent providing automated compose operations.

---

### Python UV
**Lightning-fast Python package management** ⚡

**Why it matters**: Speeds up dependency installation, manages virtual environments efficiently, and ensures reproducible builds.

**Usage tips**:
```bash
uv pip install <package>       # Fast installs
uv venv                        # Create environments
uv run <command>               # Isolated execution
```

**Integration**: Used in CI/CD pipelines for Python dependency management, integrated into MCP utilities for volume persistence.

---

## 🤖 AI Agent Tools

### File Operations
**Intelligent file and directory management** 📁

**Why it matters**: Enables automated code modifications, template processing, and file system navigation.

**Usage tips**:
- Recursive directory listing
- Content searching with patterns
- Safe file writing with backups

**Integration**: Powers the agent's file manipulation capabilities, used in development workflows for code generation.

---

### Config Management
**Centralized configuration handling** ⚙️

**Why it matters**: Centralizes configuration management, supports environment-specific overrides, and ensures consistency.

**Usage tips**:
- Reads from `.config/` directories
- Supports nested YAML/JSON configs
- Validates schema compliance

**Integration**: Manages all stack configurations (basic-stack, cluster-example, etc.), integrated with deployment automation.

---

### Docker Operations
**Programmatic container control** 🐋

**Why it matters**: Provides programmatic control over container lifecycle, supports complex orchestration scenarios.

**Usage tips**:
- Multi-stage build handling
- Service scaling automation
- Health monitoring with retries

**Integration**: Core to the agent's Docker capabilities, used for automated testing and deployment workflows.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Tools

### Semantic Search
**Natural language codebase exploration** 🔎

**Why it matters**: Accelerates code comprehension, finds related functionality, and supports refactoring decisions.

**Usage tips**:
- Search for function names
- Variable pattern matching
- Documentation comment lookup

**Integration**: Enhances the agent's code analysis capabilities, used in development and debugging workflows.

---

### Change Tracking
**Git diff analysis and impact assessment** 📊

**Why it matters**: Provides context for changes, identifies potential breaking changes, and supports review processes.

**Usage tips**:
- Analyze staged vs unstaged changes
- Track file modification history
- Assess merge conflict impacts

**Integration**: Powers the agent's change analysis tools, essential for CI/CD validation and deployment safety.

---

### Validation
**Comprehensive quality assurance** ✅

**Why it matters**: Ensures code quality, catches errors early, and maintains project standards.

**Usage tips**:
- Docker Compose file validation
- Python syntax checking
- YAML/JSON schema validation

**Integration**: Integrated into CI/CD pipelines, used by the agent for automated quality assurance.
