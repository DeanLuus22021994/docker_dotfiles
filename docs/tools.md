# Key Tools Overview

## Development Tools

### GitHub CLI
Command-line interface for GitHub operations. Essential for repository management, pull requests, and issue tracking without leaving the terminal.

**Why it matters**: Streamlines GitHub workflows, integrates with CI/CD pipelines, and supports automation scripts.

**Usage tips**: Use `gh repo clone` for quick cloning, `gh pr create` for PR management, and `gh issue list` for tracking work.

**Integration**: Powers the agent's GitHub operations tool, enabling automated repository interactions.

### Docker Compose
Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Orchestrates complex services with single commands.

**Why it matters**: Simplifies local development environments, ensures consistent deployments, and supports scaling.

**Usage tips**: Use `docker-compose up -d` for background services, `docker-compose logs -f` for monitoring, and `docker-compose exec` for debugging.

**Integration**: Core to all stack deployments (basic, cluster, swarm), with agent providing automated compose operations.

### Python UV
Fast Python package manager and virtual environment tool. Replaces pip with better performance and dependency resolution.

**Why it matters**: Speeds up dependency installation, manages virtual environments efficiently, and ensures reproducible builds.

**Usage tips**: Run `uv pip install` for packages, `uv venv` for environments, and `uv run` to execute in isolated contexts.

**Integration**: Used in CI/CD pipelines for Python dependency management, integrated into MCP utilities for volume persistence.

## AI Agent Tools

### File Operations
Core functionality for reading, writing, and managing files and directories. Essential for code generation and configuration updates.

**Why it matters**: Enables automated code modifications, template processing, and file system navigation.

**Usage tips**: Supports recursive directory listing, content searching, and safe file writing with backups.

**Integration**: Powers the agent's file manipulation capabilities, used in development workflows for code generation.

### Config Management
Handles YAML and JSON configuration files, environment variables, and settings management across the project.

**Why it matters**: Centralizes configuration management, supports environment-specific overrides, and ensures consistency.

**Usage tips**: Reads from `.config/` directories, supports nested configurations, and validates schema compliance.

**Integration**: Manages all stack configurations (basic-stack, cluster-example, etc.), integrated with deployment automation.

### Docker Operations
Advanced Docker container and image management, including building, running, and monitoring services.

**Why it matters**: Provides programmatic control over container lifecycle, supports complex orchestration scenarios.

**Usage tips**: Handles multi-stage builds, service scaling, and health monitoring with automatic retries.

**Integration**: Core to the agent's Docker capabilities, used for automated testing and deployment workflows.

## Analysis Tools

### Semantic Search
Natural language search across the codebase for understanding code patterns, functions, and documentation.

**Why it matters**: Accelerates code comprehension, finds related functionality, and supports refactoring decisions.

**Usage tips**: Search for function names, variable patterns, or documentation comments to locate relevant code.

**Integration**: Enhances the agent's code analysis capabilities, used in development and debugging workflows.

### Change Tracking
Git diff analysis and impact assessment for understanding code modifications and their effects.

**Why it matters**: Provides context for changes, identifies potential breaking changes, and supports review processes.

**Usage tips**: Analyze staged vs unstaged changes, track file modifications, and assess merge impacts.

**Integration**: Powers the agent's change analysis tools, essential for CI/CD validation and deployment safety.

### Validation
Comprehensive syntax checking, configuration validation, and compliance verification across all project files.

**Why it matters**: Ensures code quality, catches errors early, and maintains project standards.

**Usage tips**: Validates Docker Compose files, Python syntax, YAML configurations, and security compliance.

**Integration**: Integrated into CI/CD pipelines, used by the agent for automated quality assurance.

## Tool Ecosystem Integration

### MCP Protocol Support
Model Context Protocol enables secure tool calling between agents and external services.

**Why it matters**: Extends agent capabilities with external tools like GitHub and Playwright MCP servers.

**Usage tips**: Automatically enabled for supported tools, provides structured communication patterns.

**Integration**: Core to agent extensibility, allows integration with development and testing tools.

### Environment Variables
Centralized configuration through environment variables for all tools and services.

**Why it matters**: Enables secure credential management, environment-specific configurations, and deployment flexibility.

**Usage tips**: Use `.env` files for local development, GitHub secrets for CI/CD, and agent-managed variables for automation.

**Integration**: Powers all configuration management, from Docker secrets to agent tool authentication.

### Volume Persistence
Docker named volumes for persistent data across container rebuilds, especially for Python utilities.

**Why it matters**: Maintains installed packages and configurations between deployments, speeds up development cycles.

**Usage tips**: Use `docker_python_mcp` for MCP utilities, `docker_db_data` for databases, and dedicated volumes for caches.

**Integration**: Essential for MCP server persistence, integrated into all stack configurations.

## Development Workflow Integration

### Automated Testing
Integrated testing frameworks with coverage reporting and automated execution.

**Why it matters**: Ensures code quality, catches regressions, and supports continuous integration.

**Usage tips**: Run `pytest` for unit tests, `docker-compose test` for integration, and coverage tools for metrics.

**Integration**: Built into CI/CD pipelines, triggered by configuration changes and code commits.

### Health Monitoring
Real-time service health checks and performance monitoring across all stacks.

**Why it matters**: Ensures service reliability, provides early failure detection, and supports proactive maintenance.

**Usage tips**: Monitor with `docker-compose ps`, check logs with `docker-compose logs`, and use health endpoints.

**Integration**: Configured per stack, integrated with alerting systems and automated recovery.

### Security Scanning
Automated vulnerability assessment and security compliance checking.

**Why it matters**: Identifies security risks, ensures compliance, and protects against known vulnerabilities.

**Usage tips**: Scan images with Trivy, check dependencies with safety tools, and validate configurations.

**Integration**: Part of CI/CD pipelines, integrated with GitHub Security tab and automated reporting.
